# KicadLibraryUpdater
Simple tool to update local kicad libraries from github repositories. 

Written in python.

## Current status
python script for command line that:
- holds library names and git urls in an JSON config
- can add/remove libraries and git urls to this JSON config
- can update libraries, contained by the JSON config

## TODO
- make an GUI in QT and implement all neccessary functions
- create an executable file from the python scripts (pyinstaller ...)

## future works
- look into how to add features to kicad itself
- implement this function - gui into kicad
